# Problem Summary

## Company Context

EdAccelerator is an online English tutoring company serving students aged 7–15 (Years 1–10). After working with 1,167+ students over 7+ years, the company has identified a recurring pattern in why students underperform in English.

## Systemic Problem (Company-Wide)

Students aged 7–15 are underperforming in English (reading & writing) — not due to intelligence, language background, or reading volume — but due to three systemic gaps in how they are currently supported.

### 1. Lack of Consistency

- Students don't practise English regularly or in a structured way.
- Occasional writing tasks or workbooks rarely produce real progress.
- Without weekly accountability, habits don't form.

### 2. Lack of Individual Support

- Most schools and tutors do not provide detailed, personalised feedback on student writing.
- Students can't improve if they don't know what they're doing wrong.
- Generic group instruction misses individual skill gaps.

### 3. Delayed or Absent Intervention

- Many students fall further behind because they never receive timely help.
- Parents face uncertainty or have had past failed tutoring experiences.
- Inaction compounds the problem — waiting and hoping doesn't work.

## Feature-Specific Problem: Reading Comprehension Interface

EdAccelerator's current reading comprehension tool is functional but failing on engagement and learning outcomes. The company is rebuilding it from the ground up.

### What's Broken

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Low engagement** | Students dread the exercises — it "feels like a test, not like learning." |
| **Gameable format** | Multiple-choice questions let students guess rather than demonstrate understanding. |
| **No retention** | Students finish questions and immediately forget the passage — no reason to deeply understand. |
| **Weak error feedback** | When answers are wrong, explanations exist but students just click "continue" — no learning loop. |
| **Passage presentation** | Full passage shown at once is overwhelming; students can't navigate back to specific parts. |
| **One-size-fits-all** | Same interface for all ages/levels — doesn't work for an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old alike. |

### Root Cause

The current tool treats comprehension as **assessment** (test → score) rather than **learning** (read → understand → apply → reinforce). The interface lacks adaptive pacing, meaningful feedback loops, and age-appropriate presentation.

| Segment               | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Struggling students    | Below grade-level, lacking confidence in class                     |
| Intermediate students  | "Average" but capable of more with the right support               |
| Advanced students      | High-performing but not reaching full potential                    |
| Special needs students | Require adapted approaches to improve English skills               |
| Homeschool students    | Need structured English curriculum and expert guidance              |
| Test prep students     | Preparing for selective school or university entry exams            |

## Impact

- Students disengage from English or develop negative attitudes toward it.
- Confidence erodes, affecting broader academic performance.
- Parents feel helpless and unsure how to intervene effectively.
- Reading comprehension — a core pillar of the program — underperforms on outcomes despite existing tooling.
