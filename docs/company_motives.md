## Why EdAccelerator Exists

1. **Schools aren't providing enough individual support.**
   - Class sizes and curriculum constraints mean most students don't receive detailed feedback on their writing.
   - EdAccelerator fills this gap with personalised 1-on-1 and small-group instruction.

2. **Existing tutoring solutions underdeliver.**
   - Many tutors don't provide the structured, feedback-driven approach students need.
   - EdAccelerator's methodology combines individual attention with group dynamics to accelerate progress.

3. **Parents need a trusted, results-backed option.**
   - 7+ years of operation, 1,167+ students served, 213+ reviews at 4.9/5 stars.
   - A 3-month grade-improvement guarantee removes financial risk for parents.

## Motive for the New Feature: AI Reading Comprehension Interface

| Motive | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Comprehension is a core pillar** | Reading comprehension is a key part of the English program — if this tool underperforms, the whole program is weakened. |
| **Engagement is dropping** | Current tool is functional but students find it uninspiring. Declining engagement threatens learning outcomes and retention. |
| **Differentiation via AI** | Using AI to generate questions and provide personalised feedback positions EdAccelerator ahead of competitors still using static question banks. |
| **Scalable personalisation** | AI-generated questions + adaptive difficulty allows the tool to serve the full age/skill spectrum without manual content creation for each level. |
| **Product-led growth** | A compelling, best-in-class reading tool can become the primary learning tool — driving daily student interaction beyond scheduled tutor sessions. |
| **Learning outcomes over testing** | Shifting from assessment to learning aligns with the company's pedagogical identity (feedback-driven, confidence-building). |
