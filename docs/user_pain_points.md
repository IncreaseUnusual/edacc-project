1. **Child is struggling and parent doesn't know how to help**
   - Parents may not feel confident assisting with English themselves.
   - Busy schedules limit the time available to support schoolwork.

   - Some students "hate" English — they've lost motivation entirely.
   - Parents worry about long-term academic consequences.

3. **Previous tutoring attempts have failed**
   - Past experiences with other tutors didn't produce results.
   - This creates hesitation and distrust of tutoring as a solution.

4. **Uncertainty about online learning effectiveness**
   - Parents worry their child won't stay engaged in online classes.
   - Younger children (age 8+) may seem too young for remote learning.

   - Schools provide grades but not actionable feedback.
   - Parents can't identify specific skill gaps.

6. **Fear of wasting money**
   - Tutoring is an investment; results aren't always guaranteed.

## Student Pain Points: Reading Comprehension Tool (Direct Feedback)

These are verbatim-derived pain points from student feedback on the current reading comprehension interface.

| # | Pain Point | Student Quote (paraphrased) | Implication |
|---|------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Passage is overwhelming** | "It's annoying seeing the entire passage all at once. Can you break it apart?" | Need chunked/progressive passage display. Passage length must stay the same. |
| 2 | **Multiple choice is gameable** | "Multiple choice is too easy, I can just guess. Can you make it so we have to type?" | Need free-text / short-answer input. AI must evaluate typed responses. |
| 3 | **No retention** | "I finish the questions and immediately forget what I read. There's no reason to actually understand the passage." | Need a mechanism that rewards deep comprehension, not just correct answers. |
| 4 | **Wrong-answer feedback is ignored** | "When I get an answer wrong, I don't really learn why. The explanation is there but I just click continue." | Passive feedback doesn't work. Need active engagement with the explanation (e.g. follow-up question, re-read prompt). |
| 5 | **Feels like a test** | "It feels like a test, not like learning. I dread doing these." | UX must shift from assessment mode to learning mode. Tone, pacing, and interaction design matter. |
| 6 | **Can't navigate the passage** | "Sometimes I want to go back and re-read a specific part but I can't find it quickly." | Need passage navigation — section anchors, search, or chunked view with easy back-navigation. |
| 7 | **Not adaptive to skill level** | "My younger brother uses the app too and he's way slower at reading. The same interface doesn't work for both of us." | Interface must adapt to age/reading level — pacing, chunk size, question difficulty, and UI complexity. |
