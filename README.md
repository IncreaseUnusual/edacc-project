# EdAccelerator — AI Reading Comprehension Interface

A next-generation reading comprehension tool that turns passive reading tests into active, guided learning experiences. Built for students aged 7–15.

## The Problem

The current reading comprehension tool is functional but students find it uninspiring:
- Passages shown all at once are overwhelming
- Multiple choice is too easy to guess
- No reason to deeply understand the passage
- Wrong-answer feedback gets ignored
- Feels like a test, not learning
- Can't navigate back to re-read
- Same interface for all skill levels

## The Solution

An AI-powered reading experience that **teaches** instead of **tests**:
- **Chunked passages** — read one section at a time
- **Free-text answers** — type or speak (voice input via mic)
- **AI-evaluated responses** — Gemini assesses understanding, not just keywords
- **Active follow-ups on errors** — wrong answers trigger a targeted follow-up question, not just a static explanation
- **Read aloud** — natural TTS with 1x / 1.5x / 2x speed controls
- **Adaptive difficulty** — Easy / Medium / Hard changes question depth and feedback style

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| AI | Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google Generative AI) |
| TTS | ElevenLabs (optional) or browser speechSynthesis (fallback) |
| STT | Web Speech API (built-in, no key needed) |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Google Generative AI API key ([get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- (Optional) An ElevenLabs API key for natural text-to-speech

### Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd edaccproj
npm install
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your API key(s):

```
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here  # optional
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Design Decisions

Every design choice traces to a specific student complaint. See [docs/product_spec.md](docs/product_spec.md) for the full pain-point → design-decision mapping.

| Student Pain Point | Design Response |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Passage overwhelming | Chunked, progressive reveal |
| MC is gameable | Free-text + voice input only |
| No retention | Questions tied to each chunk |
| Feedback ignored | Active follow-up loop on errors |
| Feels like a test | Warm tone, no timers, read-aloud |
| Can't navigate back | Previous chunks stay accessible |
| Not adaptive | Difficulty picker at start |

## AI Question Generation Approach

Questions are generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash at session start:
1. Passage is pre-chunked into sections.
2. Gemini receives the full passage, chunk boundaries, and selected difficulty tier.
3. Returns structured questions mapped to specific chunks.
4. Questions test genuine comprehension (inference, analysis) — not surface-level recall.
5. On wrong answers, Gemini generates a targeted follow-up in real-time.
