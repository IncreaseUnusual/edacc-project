4.9/5 star rating

Are you looking to help your child improve their English grades in school?

If so, then here's how you can improve their English grades – and self-esteem – by leaps and bounds…

After helping 893+ students improve their English grades, we've come to realise that there are really just three key underlying reasons why students struggle with English.

Surprisingly, these reasons have nothing to do with:

How smart your child is

Whether English is their first language

Or even how much time they spend reading

Instead, they come down to a few simple factors — ones you can actually address and improve from home – regardless of how busy you are or how confident you feel helping them with English.

So, what are these three core reasons?


PILLAR 1

Lack of consistency
Most students don’t struggle with English due to ability — it’s usually a lack of regular practice. Occasional writing or workbook tasks rarely lead to real progress. What makes the difference is consistent, structured practice with a teacher who can guide, motivate, and hold them accountable each week.


PILLAR 2

Lack of individual support
Students can’t improve their writing without knowing what they’re doing wrong. But most schools and tutors don’t provide detailed feedback. To progress, your child needs someone to review their work regularly and give specific advice on how to improve.


PILLAR 3

Not getting support when it's needed
Many students fall further behind simply because they never get the help they need. Whether it’s uncertainty or past failed attempts, the result is the same: inaction. If your child is struggling, the key is to act — not wait and hope things fix themselves.

Factor #3 is exactly why we offer a 3-month guarantee.

If your child joins our program, attends two lessons a week, and doesn’t improve by at least one grade after three months — you don’t pay for those three months. 

We do this because we know our system works — and we want to take away the risk so it’s easier for parents to take that first step.

We’ll ask a few quick questions to make sure we’re the right fit, and if your child qualifies for the guarantee, we’ll walk you through exactly how it all works.

I've been to a lot of tutors in my time, but I have never, ever seen one like this. The teachers are so experienced, providing helpful feedback, regardless if it was a bad question. There is always a way to improve, there are many videos to show you how to improve on specific things, such as how to improve on patterns etc.

There are also many practice exams to help improve yourself, finding your weaknesses and strengths. All tutors are very experienced, and all want you to improve and achieve your goals.

I could not recommend this tutor enough.

My son recently took an English writing class and I have to say it was an amazing experience. The instructor was knowledgeable, patient, and supportive throughout the course. He learned a lot about writing techniques that have helped him improve his writing skills tremendously.  We are already looking forward to attending the next class to continue honing his writing skills. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!

These are the types of people whom you might rely on for your problems as they are always so supportive and caring. Overall, it is your opinion on whether to choose this program or not, but if you are not, then you are missing out.

My 8-year-old son recently started English tutoring with Edaccelerator, and I couldn’t be happier with our experience so far. I was initially worried that he might not enjoy online classes or stay engaged, but he absolutely loves it. The lessons are fun, interactive, and tailored perfectly to his level, and the tutor has been so encouraging and patient.
